The W3C Schemas (xsd) files work with current versions of Saxon, but we are having an issue with the Xerces parser and MathML 3.0. 

The XSD files using MathML 2.0 will work with Xerces.

Updates will be sent to the jats-list when they are available (http://www.mulberrytech.com/JATS/JATS-List/).

The W3C Schema files in this directory were all replaced today with versions that work with both Saxon and Xerces.
